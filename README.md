# SQL, MySQL, MySQL Workbench Classes
On this repository you will find all my notes taken during the course of my studies on SQL and MySQL as a DBMS.

Not only that, you will also find every challenge proposed by the instructor as well as fixation exercises done during the lessons.

## 📓 Notes
To take a look at the notes, you can access the `courseNotes.sql` file.


## 🏋🏼‍♂️ Exercises & Challenges
To take a look at the class exercises, you can access the `courseExercises.sql` file.

Every other file is a solution to the proposed challenge of the same name and every step contains an introduction to what you are supposed to do.

## 🧠 Final Considerations

Unfortunately I can not give away the SQL data used on the start of some of these challenges and exercises. Thus, I could only provide the solution to them.

However, I hope that by studying these notes and exercise solutions this can be of use to you in any way on your endeavours. Best regards, W.A.
